You\u2019re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn\u2019t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to David R. Myers.</p><p class="mb-2">David R. Myers is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.

Myers will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
